      <description>So I have been working on kubernetes as of late and decided that if I was going to call myself a real kubernetes expert I should be running one in my home around the clock. I will write posts following these miss adventures, as I am sure I&amp;rsquo;ll do a lot of stupid things that you all can ether learn from, or use to make ones self feel better about themselves :).</description>

      <description>Setting Up Hugo So, My first blog post will be about setting up the blog. I know, I know&amp;hellip; I could just set up a word press site, but what is the fun in that. Not only is this more fun. but it should be easier for me to manage.
Why Hugo? Because it&amp;rsquo;s written in go, compiles quickly (nice while on the go with minimum resources) and lets me edit on the fly.</description>
