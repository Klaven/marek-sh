So, it's be a while, and i'm exploring how I share my experiances and knowledge. I have done twitch, blogging and youtube. Links to all of those are below. To be honest I have been slacking on both twitch and bloggig.

Twenty twenty has not made this easy. Not only that, but I decided to focus on one platform for a few months. That ended up being youtube, I have really enjoyed the platform and making videos. That being said I plan on slowly integrating the other two back. Hopefully in a way that improveds the experiances of the others.

So, that being said... Dont expect me to start writing every few days! I plan on doing write ups that go along with my videos. Though for a while I will probably only do one every once in a while as I figure out how to manage it all.

The first thing I'm going to add back is the blog. I think I have a better understanding of how it will integrate with what i'm doing. So, hopfully you will start seeing at least two write up's a month.

I'm going to be bringing the live streams back a little bit slower. I could just stream whatever, like I had been doing. And I might return to doing that at some point. But I first want to bring purpose and reason to my streams when I do stream. I have a few ideas of how I might do this but I'm going to take my time and try and do it right.

Another consideration that i'm trying to make is managing my time. I want to make sure i'm spending the best way that I can.
