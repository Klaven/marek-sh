# Setting Up Hugo

 So, My first blog post will be about setting up the blog. I know, I know... I could just set up a word press site, but what is the fun in that. Not only is this more fun. but it should be easier for me to manage.

## Why Hugo?

 Because it's written in go, compiles quickly (nice while on the go with minimum resources) and lets me edit on the fly. I also liked how they do templates and the likes. Are there other solutions? yes. Do other solutions work well? probably. 

 [installing hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) is quick and simple. and the [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) are fantastic. For the base i'm starting off with [Call me Sam.](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-sam/) because I liked its simplicity. I will probably update it's main at some point. (aka updating all typeface to use [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/))
